# Introduction to JAFF

JAFF stands for "Just Another Framework" and I know what you are thinking: "Another framework? _Really?!?!_"

No, the world does not need another framework.

But, In the past year of coding javascript I've learned a lot and I have a bunch of ideas I'd like to explore.
I've found no better way to do this than to write code, change it, throw it out, re-write code, until it I fully
understand the problem and it's solution.

And with that JAFF is born.
